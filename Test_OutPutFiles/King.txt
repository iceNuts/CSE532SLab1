4 Our hasty sending. Something have you heard 
7 Resembles that it was. What it should be, 
35 Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
2 Moreover that we much did long to see you, 
13 That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court 
10 I cannot dream of: I entreat you both 
3 The need we have to use you did provoke 
11 That, being of so young days brought up with him, 
1 Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern! 
17 Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus, 
5 Of Hamlet's transformation; so I call it, 
8 More than his father's death, that thus hath put him 
9 So much from the understanding of himself, 
14 Some little time: so by your companies 
15 To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather, 
12 And since so neighbour'd to his youth and humour, 
16 So much as from occasion you may glean, 
6 Since nor the exterior nor the inward man 
18 That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
